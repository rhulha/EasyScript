# Simple test with log function and variable assignment
a = 5
b = "Hello"

log("a = " + a)
log("b = " + b)

# Using EasyScript conditional logic with NEW else: support!
# EasyScript now supports if-else statements
log(if a > 3: "a is greater than 3" else: "a is not greater than 3")

log("Hello from EasyScript!")

"Final result: success"
